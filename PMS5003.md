Install pip and other dependencies: 

                                  sudo apt-get install python3-pip

                                  sudo apt-get install python-pip (For Python 2)

                                  sudo apt install git

                                  git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/enviroplus-python

                                  cd enviroplus-python

                                  sudo ./install.sh

Once that's all done, type sudo reboot to reboot your Pi and apply the changes to the Pi's interfaces.
The  scripts mentioned above enable I2C, SPI, and serial, disables the serial console, and enables the miniuart interface that the Pi uses to talk to the PMS5003 particulate sensor.
There are several examples in the examples folder within the enviroplus-python folder.

                                  cd examples

                                  python pm.py

The result would be something like this
